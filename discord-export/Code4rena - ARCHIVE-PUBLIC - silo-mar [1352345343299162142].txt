I can't see additional details but can submit findings, does that mean I can participate in this contest or not?


[03/25/2025 06:21] _givn
Running the vault tests with a different profile worked for me:
`FOUNDRY_PROFILE=vaults-tests forge test  --no-match-test "_skip_" --no-match-contract "SiloIntegrationTest" --ffi`

`Ran 37 test suites in 23.20s (100.26s CPU time): 300 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (300 total tests)`

Not sure if these are all tests, but its a start.
You also need to configure `.env` with rpc endpoints.


[03/25/2025 06:28] tonyxx7
Also work for me, should add --ffi after the original command.


[03/25/2025 07:17] derastephh
Haha this man😅


[03/25/2025 08:24] eddiepumpin
Does this mean tokens with 6 decimals to 18 decimals are not used?

`Error: Inline config error at silo-vaults/test/foundry/fromCore/max/maxWithdraw/MaxRedeem.i.sol:0:0:0: invalid profile `vaults-tests.fuzz.runs = 1000`; valid profiles: core, core_test, core_with_invariants, core_with_test, default, oracles, proposals, vaults, vaults_tests, vaults_with_tests, ve_silo, ve_silo_test, vaults-with-tests` I get this error while trying to run Vault tests


[03/25/2025 09:01] _givn
This is a bit weird, since SiloVault has this check in the constructor:
```js
uint256 decimals = TokenHelper.assertAndGetDecimals(_asset);
require(decimals <= 18, ErrorsLib.NotSupportedDecimals());
```
Am I missing something here or there's a conflict with the contest readme?


[03/25/2025 09:03] heliosophistxiv
There is no conflict


[03/25/2025 09:04] heliosophistxiv
Tokens with decimals greater than 18 are out of scope and the code actually enforces that (at least in that line where you copied)

@Horpheyhemmy yes i did

@Horpheyhemmy and everything is working perfectly, except that silo requires 0.3.0

[03/27/2025 12:26] kartoonjoy
Most audits dont pay out for gas opts now. If an audit isn't paying out, you don't need to focus there.

If an audit did though, then yes, it would be 1 cumulative report for gas too.

here: https://docs.morpho.org/overview/concepts/irm/


[03/27/2025 18:09] elser17
Is it in scope the fact that SiloVault can deploy funds to ERC4626 external contracts (not Silo markets)?


[03/27/2025 18:29] elser17
And last ERC4626 markets in supplyQueue are expected to be the first ones in the withdrawalQueue? Or this is not necessarily like this?


[03/27/2025 21:36] aiham.eth
By design, Silo Vaults don't perform any checks whether funds are deployed to Silo markets or not.


[03/27/2025 21:37] aiham.eth
Both queues are independent of each other.

[03/28/2025 09:30] mohd.shadab
I think it is used for reward distribution to the user who actually stakes in their protocol

@Aiham quick one.
The previous audits on Silo, has fixes been done on it in the codebase?

where you able to make the test suite and run your test.


[03/28/2025 22:46] deeney3866
Have been trying to write my POC but the test folder is not found.


[03/28/2025 22:47] deeney3866
I think this would help. Thanks will try it out tomorrow.

Also, how does SiloIncentivesController contract get the reward tokens that are distributed as rewards? Does anybody fund it?

Do we know what has been updated since the previous audit ?


[03/29/2025 13:45] luc1jan
Did anyone had issues with Solidity extension in vscode/cursor? Since it's monorepo, I think its a problem. I moved all remappings to settings.json like this, if anyone knows how to solve this, I'd appreciate it.

[03/29/2025 14:08] luc1jan
Yes its extension problem, but i usually fix it with settings.json so i think its just configuration issue.


[03/29/2025 14:09] luc1jan
Not sure how to fix in this case

Hi, In SiloIncentivesController, the NOTIFIER's decimal is always 18 right? 
low decimals tokens are not used for this part right ?

Hey @admin  Is it normal I can't see my submitted PoC's in my Findings?

@kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇 hello please i have a question,
would all the compliance issue be dupped as 1?


[03/31/2025 21:01] itsmetechjay
It will be up to the judge to determine the final duplicate sets.


[03/31/2025 21:02] itsmetechjay
Submitted POCs should be part of the submission.

{Reactions}
😲 

[03/31/2025 21:04] fils7
But when I went to the submitted reports the layout was different so I tranfered my POC to the area where it said ProofOfConcept (Optional)
Now I cant see submitted POCs


[03/31/2025 21:04] fils7
What if i get invalidated because of this @Jay | C4 ?


[03/31/2025 21:22] itsmetechjay

I had submitted a finding from the PublicAllocator.sol contract which is in scope, according to the docs. Why is the finding  marked as out of scope?

How is judging going ?


[04/15/2025 10:50] kyosi2963
What does 'Disputed' status mean ?


[04/15/2025 11:16] cloudellie
It means the sponsor team disagrees with the validity, severity, or both.

[04/15/2025 11:16] kyosi2963
So it's basically invalidated, alright


[04/15/2025 11:16] kyosi2963
Is that the final decision for a report?


[04/15/2025 11:17] cloudellie
No - sponsors' input is merely advisory to the judge. The judge's evaluation is final.

Hi @0xnev , saw your [comment](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-03-silo-finance/submissions/S-566?commentParent=bZsZq6DuqbT); could you elaborate please on what magnitude of numerical impact (or anything specific) you are looking for in the asked PoC for it to be considered a `High`? My submission was [S-78](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-03-silo-finance/submissions/S-78), a part of that group.

From what I see under [C4 severity classification description](https://docs.code4rena.com/competitions/severity-categorization#estimating-risk):
```
3 — High: Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals).
```
there is no magnitude of fund loss as a requirement for `High` categorization on C4, so want to be sure of what needs to be shown in the PoC? The [S-78](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-03-silo-finance/submissions/S-78) already describes how assets are being lost with no hand-wavy hypotheticals, but happy to attempt further analysis if you could clarify the ask please. I am presently not clear which aspects from C4 severity classification criterion render it `Med` currently as per you and what to focus on in any PoC such that it transitions to `High` . Thanks.


[04/25/2025 07:01] t0x1c.c0de
Have added a PoC meanwhile based on my current understanding of expectations, please refer: https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-03-silo-finance/submissions/S-78?commentParent=SMF4fxJU4fF


[04/25/2025 08:36] 0xnevi
Thank you I will take a look soon, I wanted to see

1. For a realistic amount of funds in the SiloVault and its markets, how much fee loss would be accrued
2. Context of when a transfer would be invoked (standard transfer/reallocation etc..) , given deposits/withdrawals would accrue it appropriately
